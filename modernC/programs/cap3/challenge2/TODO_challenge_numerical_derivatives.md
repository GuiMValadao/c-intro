Challenge 2 (Numerical derivatives).

Something we’ll deal with a lot is the concept of numerical algorithms. To get your hands dirty, see whether you can implement the numerical derivative double f(double x) of a function double F(double x).
Implement this with an example F for the function you use for this exercise. A good primary choice
for F would be a function for which you know the derivative, such as sin, cos, or sqrt. Doing
so allows you to check your results for correctness.
